Our emotions and behaviors become shields to avoid being hurt. This survival mechanism, while instinctive, can hinder authentic connections in adulthood.","quote":"“Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity, and change.”"},{"id":2,"section_title":"Understanding Persona and Masks","section_body":"The term 'persona' represents the masks we wear to hide our true selves. While they provide a sense of safety, they often suffocate our ability to connect deeply with others and reveal our vulnerabilities.","quote":"“The word persona is a Greek term for ‘stage mask.’”"},{"id":3,"section_title":"The Clumsy Nature of Armor in Childhood","section_body":"During preadolescence, we try various forms of armor that can feel awkward and ill-fitting.
