{"book_name":"Daring Greatly by Brene Brown.pdf","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":2,"chapter_title":"TO DARE GREATLY","summary":"In this chapter, Brene Brown introduces the concept of 'daring greatly,' inspired by Theodore Roosevelt's speech about true courage and vulnerability. She emphasizes that vulnerability is essential for engagement, courage, and connection. It is about being all in, acknowledging the uncertainty and emotional exposure in life rather than avoiding it. Brown argues that waiting for perfection leads to missed opportunities and relationships; true courage comes from stepping into the arena, despite our fears. Ultimately, daring greatly transforms how we live, love, and lead.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A person stepping into an arena, a grand open space, warm and inviting lighting, #D2BBA0, #4B2E2B, #BA8B6A, hopeful, minimalistic art style, digital illustration, close-up focus on the figure --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"inspiring and motivational","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#EDE4D9","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#1D1D1D","#9B643D","#4B2E2B","#C47A4D","#703C3C","#BA8B6A","#B8C3A8","#6A5D4D","#2E4A3B","#E6E5D7","#1E2C27","#1A2A40","#786D85","#D9B4A6","#E5C29F","#8C3F3F"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#4B2E2B","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Daring Greatly Defined","section_body":"The term 'Daring Greatly' originates from Theodore Roosevelt's iconic speech, emphasizing courage over criticism.
