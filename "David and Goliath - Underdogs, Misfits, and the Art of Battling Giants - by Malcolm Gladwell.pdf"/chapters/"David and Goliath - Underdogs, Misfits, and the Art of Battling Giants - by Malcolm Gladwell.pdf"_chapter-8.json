Gladwell emphasizes that perceived disadvantages can provoke innovative approaches that often lead to unexpected success.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"[A determined young girl playing basketball, on a vibrant court with a cheering crowd, bright lights creating a high-energy atmosphere, [#F8F5F2, #D2BBA0, #3B3A3F], [Inspiring and dynamic], [Photorealistic], [Digital Art], [Wide-angle shot capturing the full court action] --v 6 --style raw --s 750","style":"Sports and motivational","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"The Start of an Unconventional Journey","section_body":"Vivek Ranadivé had never played basketball, yet he chose to coach his daughter's team.
